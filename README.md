> Janurary 25th, 2025
----------------------------

This program converts an image into ASCII Art using the C programming language. It requires the STB library.

This ASCII art was made from the Ruby logo, credit goes to them: (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

## Install the necessary library

1. Install STB Library:
```
git clone https://github.com/nothings/stb
```
2. Make sure that the stb library is in the same directory as the other files in this program so you won't have many issues. If you do put the stb library in a different PATH, you will need to modify the preprocessors to match such change

## Running the program

```
./a.out [YOUR IMAGE]
```
